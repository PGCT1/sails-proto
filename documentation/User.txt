description
	The User prototype is used to provide authentication to other objects on your site. The model implements the method 'authenticate', which checks credentials against those stored in a database. If a match is found, the id of the found object is passed to the callback.

	The controller implements session authentication with login and logout methods.

	Users may update their own profiles only, with authentication being the same as it is for other objects: either sessionor basic-auth based.
